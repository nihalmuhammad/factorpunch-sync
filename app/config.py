# ID=<id>&Return=<code>&CMD=<name>. Everything below governs what happens when

#
# The distinction that matters: a command sitting `pending` because the device

# sent-but-never-acknowledged case consumes an attempt.

# that collects the command minutes later opens a door at which nobody is
# standing. Late is worse than never here, so door commands get a short
# absolute life and are concluded honestly as undelivered when it runs out.
#
# This also makes a door command effectively one-shot. The shortest retry
# backoff is COMMAND_BACKOFF_SECONDS[0] (60s), so a TTL at or below that means
# an unacknowledged unlock can never reach a second delivery — the door cannot
# be re-opened an hour later by a retry of a command whose acknowledgement was
# lost. Raising this above the first backoff value gives that behaviour back,

# backoff window the person it names can still open that door. So a delivered
# but unacknowledged revocation is offered again much sooner than an ordinary
# command.
#
# Safe to make aggressive because a delete is idempotent in exactly the way
# E7 relies on for DATA UPDATE: deleting a user the terminal has already
# removed does nothing the second time.
#
# The shorter schedule also means a revocation that is never acknowledged
# exhausts its attempts in minutes rather than an hour. That is deliberate: a
# failed revocation is something the operator has to *act* on — walk to the
# door, pull the person some other way — and finding out quickly is worth more
# than a few extra silent retries. Nothing is ever concluded on this clock
# while the device is merely offline; that path consumes no attempts at all.

# Central provisioning of people onto access-control terminals (E3)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creating a user on an `acc` terminal does NOT let that person through a
# door. The user record and the door permission are two different tables, and
# the permission one is `userauthorize` (§3.8):
#
#     DATA UPDATE userauthorize Pin=<n><HT>AuthorizeTimezoneId=<n>
#
# AuthorizeTimezoneId names one of the device's own stored access time zones —
# a weekly schedule of intervals during which the holder may open the door.
# The two values that matter:
#
#   0  is the ZKTeco convention for "no access time zone" — the person is
#      known to the terminal, can enrol a face, verifies successfully, and is
#      then refused at the door. That is the confusing half-success this
#      setting exists to avoid, so it is NOT the default.
#   1  is the factory-default time zone on ZKTeco access panels, defined as
#      the whole week, 00:00-23:59 — i.e. "allowed at any time". It is what
#      BioTime assigns a newly created person unless a schedule is chosen.
#
# So the default is 1: a person provisioned from here can open the door as
# soon as they have enrolled a biometric, which is the workflow being built.
# A site that runs real access schedules sets this to the id of the time zone
# it has configured on the terminal. CAVEAT, stated plainly: no acknowledgement
# from real hardware has ever been observed by this application, so "1 = 24/7"
# is taken from the vendor's documented default and is not yet confirmed
# against the operator's BioFace A1.

# Query responses arriving on /iclock/querydata (E9)

# /iclock/querydata, not to /iclock/devicecmd. The reply can be split across
# several packets (`packcnt`/`packidx`), and a fragment parsed as if it were a
# whole record is the failure this section exists to prevent: a truncated
# base64 photo or a half template stored as if complete. Packets are therefore
# buffered in memory until the last one arrives, and only then parsed.
#
# In memory, deliberately. See the module comment in app/routers/adms.py: an
# incomplete transfer is disposable because the outbox command that provoked
# it is only concluded once the payload is whole, so a restart mid-transfer
# leaves the command outstanding and the device re-answers it. Persisting
# half-payloads would mean a new table holding megabytes of data that is
# useless by definition.

# How long a partly-received transfer is kept before it is abandoned. Long
# enough for a slow multi-megabyte upload over a bad link; short enough that a
# device which gives up half way does not pin memory until the next restart.

# What to answer a querydata POST with. UNCONFIRMED against hardware — the
# device 404s today and retries every ~5 seconds, so it plainly wants
# *something*, but nothing observed says what.
#
#   "tabledata"  `<tablename>=<count>`, the §3.7 bulk-upload convention. The
#                default, because the request declares `type=tabledata`, its
#                body is byte-identical in shape to a tabledata push, and it
#                carries the same `tablename=`/`count=` parameters that
#                acknowledgement is built from.
#   "ok"         a bare `OK`, which is what every other ADMS endpoint answers.
#
# One setting rather than a code change on purpose: if the terminal is still
# looping after this is deployed, the operator flips this value, restarts, and
# watches the log — no rebuild, no second unit. Whichever value stops the
# retry is new protocol evidence and belongs in push-protocol.md §3.13.

# to be set to, and it is stamped onto the device row, which in turn is
# snapshotted onto every attendance record. Nothing here ever converts a

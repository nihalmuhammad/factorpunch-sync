    modalities `type` has not been observed to carry yet. That interpretation
    of `type` is evidence, not a rule this table enforces: it is stored as
    plain data, never branched on here.

    Deliberately NOT `fingerprint_templates`. That table is SDK-sourced
    (pyzk `get_templates()` over TCP 4370), keyed on `finger_id`, and stores a

    protocol spec, not a mismatch to "fix" by renaming.

    `index` itself is a reserved word in the SQL dialects this project must
    stay portable across (MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL), so the column
    that holds the wire's `index=` value is named `record_index` — the same
    rename `AttendanceLog.record_index` already uses for the analogous field
    on `rtlog`. The value round-trips unchanged; only the column identifier
    differs from the wire.

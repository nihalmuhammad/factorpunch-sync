    ever re-offered when the device polls — so this job exists to conclude the
    commands no poll will ever resolve, and to keep history from growing
    without bound.

    Two jobs share this tick because they are two halves of one question:
    what has this queue given up on? `commands.sweep` retires the commands no
    poll will resolve; `withdraw_orphaned_templates` then retires the
    biometric templates that were queued behind one of them (E4). A user
    record that is refused is caught immediately, on the acknowledgement — but
    a user record that is *never acknowledged at all* only fails on a timer,
    and its templates must not outlive it and be delivered to a terminal that

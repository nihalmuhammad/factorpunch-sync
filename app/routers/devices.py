    (`DOOR_COMMAND_TTL_SECONDS`, 60s) instead of the queue's usual patience.

    not opened". Two failure modes go away with it: a door that opens minutes
    later at nobody, and — because the deadline is no longer than the shortest
    retry backoff — a lost acknowledgement re-opening the door repeatedly over
    the following hour. A door command from here is one-shot by construction.

    """Delete a specific finger template from device and from DB (`att` only).

    On an `acc` terminal this is REFUSED — 501 — and the refusal is a finding,
    not a gap somebody forgot to fill.

    §3.8 reproduces ZKTeco's own access-control SDK command constants, which
    the protocol reference rates as its highest-weight source. That
    enumeration carries `DATA UPDATE` for every biometric table
    (`BIODATA`, `biophoto`, `templatev10`, `facev7`), `DATA QUERY` and
    `DATA COUNT` for `biodata` — and exactly one `DATA DELETE`, for `user`.
    There is no per-template delete in the vendor's own command set, and the
    reading that makes that coherent is that a person's biometrics live with
    their user record and go when it goes.

    So the supported way to remove somebody's biometrics from an
    access-control terminal is to remove the person: DELETE
    /devices/{sn}/users/{user_id}, which queues `DATA DELETE user Pin=<n>`.
    That is said in the response, because an operator who clicked this needs
    to be told what to do instead, not merely told no.

    What this deliberately does NOT do is guess. Fabricating a delete for one
    of the biometric tables and shipping it as though it were known would put
    an unverified command on physical door hardware; if the shape were wrong
    the terminal would refuse it and the operator would be looking at a
    failure for a credential that was, in fact, still on the door — or at a
    success for one that was not removed. Both readings are worse than an
    honest refusal. UNVERIFIED either way until somebody watches a real
    BioFace A1 answer a user delete and then reports whether its face count
    dropped.

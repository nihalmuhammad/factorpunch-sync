    Before E14 the only way to do this was SQL by hand — every operator who
    wanted a test record or a departed employee gone had to be handed a
    one-off script. This is that workaround, made real and safe.

    **Refused while any device still holds this person** (a `device_employees`
    link exists for them, on any device). That link means a real door still
    recognises this pin; deleting only the server row would leave that
    credential live with no record of it anywhere — an invisible way in,
    which is worse than the gap this endpoint closes. The error names every
    door that still needs revoking first. `device_employees` is written only
    on a confirmed device acknowledgement (E3/E8), so this check is never
    fooled by a revocation that is merely queued — a still-outstanding
    revocation leaves the link in place and this refuses exactly the same as
    an untouched enrolment.

    **What is cascaded, and what survives**: see
    :func:`app.services.employee_sync.delete_employee`. In short — every
    enrolment and credential record goes (`device_employees`,
    `biometric_templates`, `employee_photos`, `fingerprint_templates`);
    `attendance_logs` never does, because a punch is historical fact already
    pushed to the operator's HRM.

    **This is not necessarily final.** If a device that was never told about
    this deletion still holds the pin locally (should not happen if the
    refusal above did its job, but a device can also enrol a pin the server
    has never heard of), a later sync will re-create the employee row from
    what the terminal reports — that is E1/E9 doing exactly what they are
    supposed to do, ingesting what the device actually has. The UI says so
    up front so it does not read as a bug later.

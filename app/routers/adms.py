"""The device-facing half of the server: ZKTeco's PUSH ("ADMS") protocols.

There is no single ADMS protocol. ZKTeco publishes **two** PUSH documents that
share the ``/iclock/*`` URL space and disagree about almost everything inside
it:

* **Attendance PUSH** (``DeviceType=att``) — the handshake answers with a
  ``GET OPTION FROM:`` block, there is no registration step, and punches
  arrive as positional TSV under ``table=ATTLOG``.
* **Security PUSH** (``DeviceType=acc``) — the handshake answers ``registry=ok``
  plus a ``RegistryCode``, registration and configuration live at
  ``/iclock/registry`` and ``/iclock/push``, and access events arrive as
  keyed TSV under ``table=rtlog``.

Both are spoken here. The rule that keeps the two production attendance
devices safe is that ``att`` is the default in every ambiguous case: a serial
speaks Security PUSH only once it has announced ``DeviceType=acc`` or called
an endpoint that exists nowhere else. See ``_protocol_for``.

The failure mode this module is written against is not a crash. It is a
device that registers, reports healthy and silently discards every punch —
which is what the previous ``if table != "ATTLOG": return "OK"`` did to
``rtlog``. Hence: dispatch on ``table`` explicitly, log anything unrecognised
instead of dropping it, and never filter records on a code we have not
actually confirmed.

# /iclock/querydata — the answer to a DATA QUERY (E9)
#
# CONFIRMED from a BioFace A1 fixture (2026-08-21 07:22
# UTC), which is the only reason this endpoint exists. push-protocol.md §3.12
# listed `/iclock/querydata` as folklore because it appears in neither vendor
# document; the device then used it. The captured request, verbatim:
#
#     POST /iclock/querydata?SN=ACCFIXTURE0001&type=tabledata&cmdid=1
#          &tablename=user&count=3&packcnt=1&packidx=1
#     user uid=1<HT>cardno=<HT>pin=1<HT>…<HT>privilege=14<HT>disable=0<HT>verify=0
#     user uid=2<HT>…
#     user uid=3<HT>…
#
# Three facts follow from it, and each one is load-bearing:
#
# 1. **The body is a tabledata body.** Same keyed TSV, same repeated table-name
#    prefix, same tables. So it is parsed by the same parsers (E1/E2/E5) and
#    not by new ones — see `_store_bulk_table`.
#
# 2. **`cmdid` is the acknowledgement.** A device answering a DATA QUERY never
#    POSTs /iclock/devicecmd; it quotes the command id here instead. Nothing
#    else will ever conclude that outbox row, so if this endpoint does not, the
#    command retries on backoff and is eventually declared failed — after it
#    already succeeded and its answer was stored.
#
# 3. **`packcnt`/`packidx` split a payload across requests.** The capture reads
#    1/1 because three user records are about 375 bytes. A `biophoto` answer is
#    ~100 KB per person and MAX_REQUEST_BYTES caps one request at 2 MB, so a
#    real photo query will arrive in pieces. Parsing a piece is the failure
#    mode this whole section is built around: `_store_photo_table` cannot tell
#    a truncated base64 photo from a small one, and would store the fragment as
#    a complete image. So nothing is parsed until the last packet lands.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part-received transfers, keyed (serial, cmdid, tablename). Guarded by a lock
# because uvicorn runs the sync endpoints in a thread pool: two packets of the
# same transfer can be in flight at once.
#
# WHY MEMORY, given it does not survive a restart mid-transfer: because an
# incomplete transfer is worth nothing. Its command is deliberately left
# outstanding until the payload is whole (see `_conclude_query`), so a restart
# that drops the buffer leaves the DATA QUERY in the outbox, the device is
# handed it again on its next poll, and it re-answers from the start. The
# recovery path is the one the queue already has. The alternative — a table of
# half-payloads — would put megabytes of provably useless data in the
# operator's database to save a re-query that costs seconds.

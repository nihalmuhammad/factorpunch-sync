"""Idempotent, additive schema migrations run on every boot.

``create_all()`` creates missing *tables* but never touches a table that
already exists, so an upgraded install would silently run without the new
columns. This module closes that gap: it compares the mapped metadata with
what the database actually has and issues ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD`` for
anything missing.

Rules this module holds to, because it runs unattended on operator databases:

* additive only — never drops, never retypes, never renames;
* safe to repeat — a second run is a no-op;
* never adds NOT NULL without a default, since existing rows must get a value;
* dialect-portable across MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL by asking the
  dialect's own type compiler rather than hard-coding SQL types.

Later units extend this file by adding columns to ``app/models.py`` (nothing
to do here — they are picked up automatically) and, if a new column needs
existing rows backfilled, by adding a statement to ``_run_data_fixups``,
which is handed the set of columns this run actually created.

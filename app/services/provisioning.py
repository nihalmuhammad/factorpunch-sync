"""Putting a person onto an access-control terminal, over the command queue.

The workflow this serves is the operator's, taken from BioTime: create the
person centrally, push them to a door, then walk up to that door and enrol a
face or a finger *on the terminal*. The device uploads the resulting template
back by itself (that is E1/E2).

Two things are pushed down from here, and they are deliberately separate
calls:

* :func:`provision` sends the *identity* — the person record and the door
  permission. It sends no biometric at all; the person enrols one at the
  terminal afterwards.
* :func:`push_templates` sends a *biometric already captured somewhere else*,
  so that somebody enrolled at one door works at every door without walking
  back to each one. That is the highest-consequence thing this application
  does: the bytes it queues become a credential on physical door hardware, so
  they are replayed verbatim from storage and never reconstructed, guessed or
  normalised (see :func:`biodata_command`).

Two commands, not one
---------------------
This is the whole reason this module exists as more than a format string.
On an `acc` terminal the person record and the door permission live in two
different tables:

    DATA UPDATE user Pin=…<HT>CardNo=…<HT>…<HT>Privilege=…
    DATA UPDATE userauthorize Pin=…<HT>AuthorizeTimezoneId=…

Send only the first and the terminal knows the person, lets them enrol, shows
their name on a successful verification — and refuses to open the door. That
half-success is hard to diagnose from the server side, because everything the
server can see says the push worked. §3.8 records that the authorization "is
delivered together with the user information", and that is what
:func:`provision` does: both commands, queued together, in that order.

There is no equivalent step on an attendance terminal, which is why it is easy
to miss and why it is spelled out at this length.

Queued is not delivered
-----------------------
Nothing in this module talks to a device. A ZKTeco terminal on ADMS is never
dialled; it collects work on its next `GET /iclock/getrequest`, roughly every
ten seconds, and reports the outcome afterwards. So :func:`provision` returns
the outbox rows it created and callers must describe that as *queued*. Delivery
and retry belong to app/services/commands.py, which is the only thing that
dispatches, and is not reimplemented here.

Who writes device_employees
---------------------------
Not this module, and not at push time. `device_employees` means "this person
is on this terminal", and until the device has acknowledged the user command
that is a hope, not a fact. :func:`note_acknowledged` writes the link when the
acknowledgement arrives, through employee_sync.link_device_employee — the same
single writer the SDK path uses. The SDK transport writes it synchronously
because there it *is* a fact by the time the call returns.

# Taking a person off a terminal (E8)

#
# Everything above this line grants access. This is the half that takes it
# away, and it is the half where the asymmetry of this whole design bites.
#
# Granting is allowed to be slow. If a `DATA UPDATE user` sits in the outbox
# for a day because the terminal is unplugged, the consequence is that
# somebody cannot get in yet — annoying, visible, self-correcting. Revoking is
# not allowed to be slow in the same way: while a `DATA DELETE user` sits in
# the outbox, the person it names can still open that door, and *nothing at
# the door itself* says otherwise. The queue's tolerance of offline devices,
# which is a feature everywhere else in this application, is here a safety
# problem. That is why revocation gets a shorter retry schedule
# (commands.backoff_for), an ERROR-level log line when it is given up on
# (commands.conclude) and a UI that refuses to describe a queued delete as a
# completed one.
#
# What is CONFIRMED, and what is not
# ----------------------------------
# `DATA DELETE user Pin=<n>` is verbatim from §3.8's own worked example
# (`C:296:DATA DELETE user Pin=1`). It is the only delete shape the protocol
# reference gives a literal example for, and it is the load-bearing one.
#
# `DATA DELETE userauthorize Pin=<n>` is DERIVED, not quoted: the generic
# grammar `DATA DELETE <table> …` is documented, the table name
# `userauthorize` is confirmed, and `Pin` is confirmed as its key from the
# UPDATE shape. See :func:`authorize_delete_command` for why it is sent
# anyway, and what happens if the terminal has already removed it.
#
# There is NO biometric delete here. Not a guessed one, not an UNVERIFIED one
# — none. See :func:`revoke_commands_for`.

    DERIVED, not quoted. §3.8 gives the generic form `DATA DELETE <table> …`,
    gives `userauthorize` as a real table, and gives `Pin` as its key. What it
    does *not* say anywhere is whether deleting the user also deletes that
    user's authorization row. Both readings are plausible and the spec settles
    neither, so this takes the safer of the two: send it, and do not depend on
    a cascade nobody has observed.

    The cost of being wrong in each direction is what decides it.

    * If the terminal *does* cascade, this command is redundant. Worst case it
      answers with a non-zero Return meaning "no such record", which is
      surfaced honestly (see the UI wording) and costs nothing but a poll.
    * If the terminal does *not* cascade and this were omitted, a
      `userauthorize` row would outlive the person it belonged to. That is
      the half-revocation this unit exists to prevent, and it is invisible
      from the server: everything we can see would say the delete worked.

    A redundant command is cheap; a stale door permission is not.

    The user record goes FIRST, and the order is the whole argument.

    A terminal collects one command per poll. If it collects exactly one and
    then loses power for a week, the one it got should be the one that
    actually revokes. That is `DATA DELETE user`: it is the confirmed shape,
    and removing the person's record removes the terminal's ability to
    recognise them at all, whatever it does about permissions. The
    authorization delete alone would leave the person still enrolled and rely
    on the device treating a missing `userauthorize` row as "no doors" — very
    probably true, entirely unverified, and not something to bet a door on.

    So: the definitely-sufficient command first, the belt-and-braces one
    behind it.

    On biometrics — the question this unit was told to ANSWER, not guess at
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is no template delete here, and that is a finding rather than an
    omission. §3.8 reproduces ZKTeco's own access-control SDK command
    constants (`namanhho/BioMatrix`, `Access/Commands.cs`), which the protocol
    reference rates as the highest-weight source it has. That enumeration
    contains `DATA UPDATE BIODATA`, `DATA UPDATE biophoto`, `DATA UPDATE
    templatev10`, `DATA UPDATE facev7`, `DATA QUERY tablename=biodata` and
    `DATA COUNT biodata` — and exactly one delete, for `user`. The vendor's
    own SDK exposes no way to delete a biometric row on its own.

    The reading that makes that consistent is that biometrics belong to the
    user record and go when it goes; a terminal offering no biometric delete
    at all, and thus no way ever to remove a face from an access controller,
    is not a credible design. So removing the person is what removes their
    templates, and `DATA DELETE user Pin=<n>` is the whole revocation.

    Stated as what it is: an inference from an absence, marked UNVERIFIED
    against real hardware, and the reason nothing here invents a delete for a
    biometric table. Inventing one and shipping it as known would be guessing
    at a command that writes physical door hardware, and if the guess were
    wrong the terminal would refuse it and the operator would be shown a
    failure for something that had, in fact, already worked.

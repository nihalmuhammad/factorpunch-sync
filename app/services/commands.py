"""Delivery of commands to a device, and the record of what became of them.

This is the *only* command delivery mechanism in the app. Anything that wants
a device to do something calls :func:`queue` and, later, reads the outcome —
nothing re-implements dispatch, retry or acknowledgement.

The shape of the problem
------------------------
A ZKTeco terminal on the ADMS/PUSH protocol is never dialled; it dials us. It
polls ``GET /iclock/getrequest`` every few seconds and we answer with the work
we have for it, formatted ``C:<id>:<command>``. Some seconds later it reports
what happened with ``POST /iclock/devicecmd`` carrying
``ID=<id>&Return=<code>&CMD=<name>``. There is no other channel, no way to ask,
and no error at push time — queueing always succeeds, so the *only* signal
that a delivery failed is an acknowledgement that never comes.

Two tables, and why
-------------------
``device_command_outbox`` holds outstanding work and nothing else; a row is
there if and only if the command is still owed to a device. ``getrequest``
scans only this, so the per-poll cost never grows with history.
``device_command_log`` is append-only history of concluded commands.

Concluding a command is a *move*: one transaction writes the log row and
deletes the outbox row, so a command is never both outstanding and concluded,
and never neither. :func:`conclude` is the single place that transition
happens.

The distinction this module exists to keep straight
---------------------------------------------------
**Offline is not failure.** A command sitting ``pending`` because the device
has not polled has attempts=0, no ``next_attempt_at``, and is failing at
nothing — it is the queue working exactly as intended. This is the behaviour
that recovered a weekend of missed punches for the operator, and it must
survive. The attempt counter and the backoff apply *only* to a command that
was actually handed to a device and never acknowledged.

A device that is switched off all weekend must come back to its queue intact,
not to a pile of failures it never had a chance to attempt.

**A ``Return`` code is read three ways, not two.** This module used to say
"``0`` is success, anything else is a refusal". Hardware disproved the second
half — see :func:`verdict_for`. A code we cannot read is now concluded, and
recorded, without being called either a success or a refusal. Only silence is
retried.

    The single owner of that judgement. It needs ``command_name`` because
    **``Return`` does not mean the same thing for every command**, which is the
    finding this whole function exists to encode.

    `DATA QUERY`: ``Return`` is a RECORD COUNT
    ------------------------------------------
    Field-confirmed on a BioFace A1 fixture, 2026-08-21, four completed
    queries:

        cmdid 1   user      3 records stored   ID=1&Return=3&CMD=DATA QUERY
        cmdid 2   biophoto  3 photos stored    ID=2&Return=3&CMD=DATA QUERY
        cmdid 3   biodata   6 records stored   ID=3&Return=6&CMD=DATA QUERY
        cmdid 4   biodata   6 records stored   ID=4&Return=6&CMD=DATA QUERY

    ``Return`` tracked the number of records the query produced, exactly,
    across three tables and two distinct counts. It was never a status. ``3``
    never meant "success" — it meant "three records", and the reason this
    firmware has never sent ``Return=0`` is simply that no query has yet
    matched nothing.

    So for a query, **any count is a success, including zero**. ``Return=0``
    means the query ran and matched no records — a real, correct, useful
    answer, and the one value the old rule would have got right for entirely
    the wrong reason. A *negative* value cannot be a count at all; there is no
    evidence for what it would be, so it is read as a refusal, which is the
    pessimistic direction.

`DATA UPDATE`: ``Return`` is a status, and ``0`` is success
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Also field-confirmed, same terminal, 2026-08-21 10:18:55–10:18:56, the
    first provisioning ever acknowledged by this deployment's hardware:

        cmdid 5   DATA UPDATE user Pin=4 …          ID=5&Return=0&CMD=DATA UPDATE
        cmdid 6   DATA UPDATE userauthorize Pin=4   ID=6&Return=0&CMD=DATA UPDATE

    Both succeeded, both answered ``0``, matching the vendor's own example in
    push-protocol.md §3.8 (``ID=295&Return=0&CMD=DATA UPDATE``). So it is now
    observation, not documentation.

    Which settles the shape of the problem: **the same wire field carries a
    record count for one verb and a status for another.** ``Return=0`` means
    "matched nothing, successfully" on a query and "did it" on an update; the
    two readings cannot be reconciled under a single rule, and that is exactly
    why the old single rule had to be wrong about one of them.

    ``0``              SUCCESS.     Observed, and documented.
    negative           REFUSAL.     Observed; see below.
    any other non-zero UNREADABLE.  Never observed on an update. Not claimed.

    No non-zero ``DATA UPDATE`` acknowledgement has been seen, so a positive
    code on one is still genuinely unknown — it could be a status this firmware
    uses for a partial result, or a count after all. It is concluded, recorded
    and surfaced, and it is claimed as neither success nor refusal. That is the
    safe way to be wrong: a missed alarm is worse than a spurious one on a
    door, so an unconfirmed revocation still shouts.

    The negative branch is no longer an inference. It was one until
    2026-08-21 11:06:06, when the operator deliberately queued a command the
    terminal could not satisfy — a query against a table that does not exist —
    to find out what a refusal actually looks like:

        cmdid 9   DATA QUERY tablename=nosuchtable,fielddesc=*,filter=*
                  ID=9&Return=-629&CMD=DATA QUERY

    So vendor error codes on this firmware *are* negative, and ``-629`` is a
    real one. The rule was already pointing the right way; it is now pointing
    that way for a reason rather than out of caution, and the behaviour E4, E8
    and E10 build on refusals rests on evidence.

    ``DATA DELETE``: status, and ``0`` is success — also confirmed
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Same terminal, 2026-08-21 10:23:25–10:23:26, a real revocation of a real
    person from a real door:

        cmdid 7   DATA DELETE user Pin=4          ID=7&Return=0&CMD=DATA DELETE
        cmdid 8   DATA DELETE userauthorize Pin=4 ID=8&Return=0&CMD=DATA DELETE

    Both succeeded, both answered ``0``, and E8's link-drop and
    "revoked and confirmed at the door" both fired correctly. This was an
    inference from the verb family until that capture; it is now observation.

    Which means **every command family this codebase actually emits is now
    evidenced**: query, update, delete. The UNREADABLE branch is no longer a
    standing fallback for anything we routinely send — it is reserved for what
    remains genuinely unobserved: a non-zero code on an update or a delete
    (never seen), and any other verb (``DATA COUNT``, or whatever an operator
    types by hand into the command box).

    That reservation still matters, and it points at the door. If a terminal
    ever answers a ``DATA DELETE`` with a count-like number, this rule reads it
    as UNREADABLE, the revocation is concluded unconfirmed, and ACCESS NOT
    REVOKED fires. Spurious, and the right way round.

    The verdict on ``return_code`` belongs to :func:`verdict_for`, which is
    three-way — success, refusal, or *unreadable* — and carries the evidence
    for each branch. Read it before changing anything here.

    Returns one word, which is both the caller's log line and the caller's
    permission to act:

    ``acknowledged``  the device confirmed it. Act on success.
    ``rejected``      the device refused it. Act on failure.
    ``unconfirmed``   the device answered with a code we cannot read. Concluded
                      — the device has replied, so there is nothing to wait for
                      — but act on **neither** outcome. This is the branch that
                      exists so a successful command is never called a refusal
                      and a refused one is never called a success.
    ``informational`` an acknowledgement for a command already concluded. The
                      outcome was decided by better evidence; nothing changes.
    ``unknown``       an id never issued to this serial. Nothing touched.
    ``duplicate``     lost the race to conclude; another ack got there first.

    Never raises and never refuses the request — a device that cannot deliver
    its ack will keep retrying the whole command, which is worse than a lost
    outcome.

    ``source`` names the endpoint the report arrived on, for the log only.
    There are two, and a ``DATA QUERY`` uses **both** (E11, field-confirmed):
    ``/iclock/querydata`` carries the payload and arrives first, then
    ``/iclock/devicecmd`` follows about half a second later with a code. E9
    read §3.13 as saying querydata was the only ack for a query; hardware says
    it is the first of two. The second one lands here on an already-concluded
    command, which is ordinary and expected, and is reported as such.

      re-sending an ack it thinks we missed. The outcome was decided by better
      evidence — the payload itself, for a query — so this changes nothing and
      is said at INFO. A WARNING here fires on every single successful query,

      things that genuinely matter.

    * **We never issued that id to this serial.** Still a WARNING: it means a
      device is quoting an id we have no record of, and that is worth a look.

    Told apart by ``device_command_log.outbox_id``. A history row written
    before that column existed has none, so an ack for one of those falls
    through to the WARNING — rare, self-correcting, and better than guessing.

    none of this is on a request path.

    Four jobs, in the order they matter:

    1. **Exhausted deliveries.** A command handed to a device the maximum
       number of times, whose last retry window has passed, is concluded
       failed. ``getrequest`` does this too, on the next poll; this covers the
       device that stopped polling part-way through its retries, so the
       failure surfaces on a timer instead of waiting for a device that may
       never return.

    1b. **Door deadlines (E15).** A door command past its ``expires_at`` is
       concluded failed and never offered again. `_eligible` already refuses
       to hand it out; this is what turns that silence into a visible outcome
       saying the door did not open.

    2. **Absolute expiry.** An outstanding command older than
       COMMAND_PENDING_EXPIRY_DAYS is abandoned regardless of status. This is
       the answer to "queued weeks ago for a terminal that was decommissioned",
       and it is deliberately a *separate, much longer* clock from the retry
       count: a month of being offline expires a command, a weekend does not.

    3. **History retention.** Prune device_command_log past its retention.
       Only concluded rows are ever pruned — the outbox is never touched by
       cleanup, because everything in it is live work.

    Note what is *not* here: nothing ages out a pending command for merely
    being undelivered. That is the queue working.

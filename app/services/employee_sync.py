"""The one place an employee row is written. Every source comes through here.

Three sources now write people, and they do not mean the same thing by an
empty field. Two of them are devices reporting what they hold — "this person
exists on this terminal":

* the **SDK pull** (``app/services/poller.pull_employees``), which reaches out
  over TCP 4370 and reads ``get_users()``;
* the **Security PUSH bulk upload** (``tabledata&tablename=user``, handled in
  ``app/routers/adms.py``), which arrives unsolicited over HTTP because a
  NATted device can only ever push.

The third is an **operator typing into the UI** (E3), who is the authority on
the row rather than a witness to it, and for whom clearing a field is a real
instruction. That difference is handled by having two entry points into this
one module — see "The other kind of source" further down — not by a second
writer somewhere else.

A device behind NAT is reachable by exactly one of those. A device on the LAN
can be reachable by both, and then the two must agree. If each transport had
its own writer with its own idea of what an empty field means, an
operator-entered name would survive one path and be erased by the other, and
the row would flip-flop on every poll. Hence: one writer, one rule, called by
both.

**The rule: a source may fill a field in, but never empty one out.** Terminals
routinely report a user with no name and no card — every one of the three
records in the BioFace A1 capture does — and that absence is the device having
nothing to say, not an instruction to erase what an operator typed.

The two conventions that follow from it:

* ``None`` and ``""`` both mean "this source has nothing to say about this
  field". They are indistinguishable on the wire (``name=`` is what an unnamed
  user looks like) so they are treated the same here.
* ``privilege`` is the exception: ``0`` is a real value (an ordinary user, as
  opposed to ``14`` for an admin), so it is applied whenever the field was
  present at all. Only an absent or unparseable ``privilege`` is ignored.

Nothing here commits. Both callers own their own transaction — the poller
commits once per pull, the ADMS handler once per upload — and a helper that
committed mid-loop would break the batch semantics of either. Each helper does
``flush()`` so that a second record for the same person inside one batch sees
the first one instead of racing it into a unique-constraint violation.

# for, including empty. Both still write through this one module, so there is
# still exactly one thing that writes `employees` — which is the property E1
# established by *removing* a competing writer, and which is worth more than
# the convenience of a second one.

# layer passes only the keys the operator actually sent (Pydantic's
# exclude_unset), so "" means clear this and absent means leave it alone.

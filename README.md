# FactorPunch Sync

A self-hosted appliance that replaces ZKTeco BioCloud. It collects attendance from ZKTeco biometric devices and exposes a clean web UI and REST API — no cloud dependency, no per-device license. It can run purely on your LAN, or — behind Apache as a TLS reverse proxy — be reached from the public internet, so devices at sites without a shared network can push attendance directly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before doing the latter.

## How it works

ZKTeco devices speak two protocols simultaneously:

| Protocol | Direction | Port | Used for |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| **ADMS** (HTTP push) | Device → Server | 80/443 | Real-time attendance push |
| **SDK** (TCP pull) | Server → Device | 4370 | Employee sync, template pull, device control |

This app runs both listeners. Devices push attendance events the moment they happen; the SDK poller lets you pull historical records, employees, and fingerprint templates on demand.

## Features

- **Real-time attendance** via ADMS push from devices
- **On-demand sync** — pull employees, attendance, and fingerprint templates from any device
- **Employee management** — view all employees, push to specific devices, remove from devices
- **Fingerprint templates** — pull from one device, push to others (one master copy per finger)
- **Live enrollment** — trigger fingerprint enrollment on a device from the UI
- **Device control** — unlock door, set clock, write LCD message, restart, queue raw commands
- **HRM integration** — push attendance records to a third-party HRM on a configurable interval, with last-synced-ID tracking and a manual trigger
- **Multi-database** — MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL (including Windows Authentication)
- **DB-backed operator accounts** — Argon2id-hashed passwords, `admin`/`viewer` roles, forced password change on first login, account lockout after repeated failures. Sessions are an opaque server-side token in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie (never a bearer token, never `localStorage`), with CSRF protection on every state-changing request. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full model.
- **Device approval queue** — an unknown device serial is refused, not auto-registered; approve it from a pending queue, or open a time-boxed pairing window while onboarding new hardware. Optional per-device source-IP allowlist.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- One of: MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL
- Node 18+ (development only — servers download a prebuilt frontend from GitHub Releases)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `uv` — `pip install uv`
- One of: MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL
- Node 18+ with npm (development only)

### Guided installer (recommended)

The installer handles everything interactively — configuration, dependencies, frontend build, and optional service registration.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd factorpunch-sync
python install.py          # production deployment
python install.py --dev    # development machine
```

Production installs download the prebuilt frontend from GitHub Releases (no
Node needed) and offer to register a background service. Dev installs build
the frontend from your checkout (Node required), set `APP_ENV=development`
(uvicorn auto-reload), and skip service registration — use `npm run dev` in
`frontend/` for hot reload while editing.

### Upgrading

```bash
python install.py --upgrade
```

`--upgrade` is non-interactive: it pulls the latest code (re-executing itself
if the installer changed), re-syncs Python dependencies, refreshes the
frontend (prebuilt download on production boxes, npm build on dev boxes —
detected from `.env`), restarts the registered service, and never touches
`.env` or asks questions. Add `--skip-pull` to upgrade without pulling.

#### Upgrading an existing (pre-hardening) install

If your `.env` predates the operator-authentication and public-internet
hardening work, `--upgrade` will not add the new keys for you — it never
touches `.env`. After upgrading:

1. Add at minimum `ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your hostname>` to `.env`. Under
   `APP_ENV=production` the app now refuses to boot without it. Copy the
   rest of the new keys from `.env.example` (`TRUSTED_PROXIES`,
   `COOKIE_SECURE`, session/lockout settings, `ENABLE_DOCS`,
   `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, `ADMS_PAIRING_MINUTES`) — every one has a safe
   default if omitted, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is the only one that's required.
2. Restart the app. On first boot against your existing database, a
   migration runs automatically: it adds the new `users`/`user_sessions`/
   `audit_log` tables, and — critically — marks every **existing** device
   row `approved` so devices already in production keep pushing without
   interruption. Only a serial the server has never seen before lands in the
   new pending-approval queue.
3. On that same first boot, since `users` is empty, the app seeds one admin
   from your existing `API_USERNAME`/`API_PASSWORD` with a forced password
   change. Log in, change the password, then delete both lines from `.env`
   — they are never consulted again after that first boot.
4. If you're now also fronting the app with Apache for the first time, see
   [Deploying behind Apache](#deploying-behind-apache-public-internet) below
   — in particular, `TRUSTED_PROXIES` has to match Apache's real source
   address or per-device IP allowlisting will misbehave.

### Releasing (maintainers)

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` and commit
2. Tag and push: `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`
3. GitHub Actions builds the frontend and attaches
   `factorpunch-sync-frontend-v<version>.zip` (plus a `.sha256` checksum) to the
   release — servers pick it up on their next `install.py --upgrade`

Keep the pyproject version and the tag in sync: servers prefer the release
matching their checked-out `pyproject.toml` version and only fall back to the
latest release if that tag has no build.

The installer will:
1. Prompt for bind address and port, the public hostname (`ALLOWED_HOSTS`) and trusted proxy addresses (`TRUSTED_PROXIES`), database credentials, and the admin bootstrap credentials
2. Write `.env` with an auto-generated secret key, `chmod`ed to `600`
3. Install Python dependencies
4. Test the database connection
5. Download the prebuilt frontend from GitHub Releases (falls back to a local npm build)
6. Optionally register a **systemd** service (Linux, with sandboxing directives — see [Deploying behind Apache](#deploying-behind-apache-public-internet)) or **NSSM Windows service** (Windows) so the app starts on boot and restarts on crash

If a `.env` already exists it will ask before overwriting (and will still `chmod` it to `600` either way).

### Manual setup

If you prefer to set things up yourself:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd factorpunch-sync
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Edit `.env`. At minimum:

```env
# First-boot bootstrap only — seeds one admin, then ignored forever. Delete
# both lines once you've logged in and changed the password.
API_USERNAME=admin
API_PASSWORD=your-password
SECRET_KEY=<python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))">

# Required under APP_ENV=production — the app refuses to boot without it.
ALLOWED_HOSTS=zk.example.com

DB_ENGINE=mariadb        # mariadb | mysql | postgresql | mssql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=zkteco_sync
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

See `.env.example` for the full list of keys (session lifetime, lockout
thresholds, `TRUSTED_PROXIES`, request body cap, etc.) — every one besides
`ALLOWED_HOSTS` has a safe default if left unset.

```bash
uv sync
npm install --prefix frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend
python run.py
```

By default the app binds to `127.0.0.1` only, so it isn't directly reachable
over the network — that's the intended setup once Apache is in front of it
(below). For a plain LAN deployment with no reverse proxy, set
`APP_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env`; `install.py` will warn you when you choose
this. Database tables (and any missing columns from an upgrade) are created
automatically on first run.

## Pointing devices at this server

On each ZKTeco device, set the ADMS / Cloud Server address to wherever the
app is actually reachable — `http://<server-ip>:8000` on a LAN deployment
with `APP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, or your public hostname over HTTPS
(`https://zk.example.com`) behind Apache.

By default an unrecognized device serial is **refused, not auto-registered**
— it must be approved before it can push anything. Two ways to get a new
device connected:

- **Pairing mode (recommended for onboarding):** open a pairing window from
  **Devices → Open pairing window** (closes automatically after
  `ADMS_PAIRING_MINUTES`, 15 by default), then power on or reboot the
  device. It appears in a pending-approval queue with the IP it connected
  from; approve it there and it starts pushing normally. Close the window
  when you're done onboarding.
- **Manual add:** add the device directly from the Devices page with its
  serial number — this auto-approves it, so only do this for a device you
  already trust.

An existing install upgrading into this behavior does not need to re-approve
anything: the upgrade migration marks every device already in the database
`approved` automatically. Only a serial the server has never seen before
lands in the pending queue.

## Deploying behind Apache (public internet)

To expose this app on the public internet, put Apache in front of it as a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy and leave the app itself on `127.0.0.1` (the
default). A complete example vhost — TLS, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, proxy
directives, HSTS, a modern cipher suite — is at
[`deploy/apache/zkteco-sync.conf.example`](deploy/apache/zkteco-sync.conf.example).

Two things are easy to get wrong and worth reading closely before you copy
that file:

1. **`/iclock/*` (the device-push endpoints) must stay on the same vhost as
   the admin UI.** Device firmware only lets you configure a hostname and
   port for its server address — there's no server-path field — so every
   device pushes to the same origin the browser uses. Splitting them apart
   breaks device pushes.
2. **`TRUSTED_PROXIES` in `.env` must match Apache's real source address**
   (almost always `127.0.0.1`, the default) for the app to resolve a
   device's or browser's real IP from `X-Forwarded-For` correctly. Get this
   wrong and per-device IP allowlisting either refuses every device or can
   be walked through with a forged header — see the long comment block in
   the example vhost, and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), for the full
   explanation.

`install.py` prompts for both `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (the hostname Apache serves)
and `TRUSTED_PROXIES` during a production install, and registers a systemd
service with sandboxing directives (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome`,
`NoNewPrivileges`, and others) suitable for a process now reachable
indirectly from the internet. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full
threat model, the accepted residual risk around device-serial forgery, and
incident-response steps.

## Web UI and REST API on one origin

The UI and the API are served from the same origin, and some paths belong to
both: `/devices`, `/employees`, `/attendance` and `/users` are client-side
routes of the app *and* real API endpoints. The server decides which one you
meant from the request, not from the path — **the default is the page; add
the XHR flag to get JSON**:

```bash
# The app: a browser hard-refreshing, bookmarking or deep-linking any route
# gets the SPA shell and client-side routing takes over.

# The API: any client sending Accept: */* (curl's default, and every script)
# gets JSON, exactly as before.
curl -b cookies.txt https://zk.example.com/devices

# Explicitly, from anything that might look like a browser:
curl -b cookies.txt -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' https://zk.example.com/devices
curl -b cookies.txt -H 'Accept: application/json'         https://zk.example.com/devices
```

`/iclock/*` is exempt from this entirely — the ADMS device protocol is
untouched. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the exact rule.

## HRM Integration

Go to **Settings → HRM Sync** in the UI to configure:

- **Endpoint** — the URL your HRM accepts attendance pushes at
- **Secret** — the API key sent with each push
- **Location ID** — identifier passed with every record
- **Interval** — how often to push (in seconds)
- **Timezone** — used to denote the timestamps pushed are in this timezone. The machine does not inform this
- **Last Synced ID** — editable; lower it to re-push records, raise it to skip

Records are batched in groups of 10,000. On failure, state is preserved so the next run resumes from where it left off.

## Development

Run backend and frontend separately with hot reload:

```bash
# Backend
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000` automatically.
